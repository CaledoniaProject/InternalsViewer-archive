The Internals Viewer - Allocation Map menu item will bring up the allocation map, which has the functionality of the standalone viewer (version 1). You should also see some additional items in the Indexes folder in the Object Browser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there is no trace of the add-in, try check in the registry that the LoadBehavior is set to 1 in  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Microsoft SQL Server\\100\\Tools\\Shell\\Addins\\InternalsViewer.SSMSAddIn.Connect or HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Microsoft SQL Server\\90\\Tools\\Shell\\Addins\\InternalsViewer.SSMSAddIn.Connect for 2005.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny\r\n",
